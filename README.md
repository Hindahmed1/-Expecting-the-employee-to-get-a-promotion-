# Expecting the employee to get a promotion

# Design:
This project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle has been used in this project. The HR Analytics Classification and the most important characteristics and data included: no_of_trainings', 'age', 'previous_year_rating', 'length_of_service', 'referred', 'sourcing' to classify the employee's attainment As promotion/not promotion.
Data:
The data set provided from Kaggle in .csv format, Contains 54,808 records,14 features each containing important metrics that can help categorize a person to be promoted or not. These features are cleaned up for ease of use and implementation using Ranking Modeling in ML.
